# Women-in-Tech


The Women in Tech website is aimed at provide women with more resources on the work environment at certain companies to facilitate choosing a job that is the best for them. Our website gathers reviews and ratings made by women and analyzes them to produce a rating that represents the companies' success in creating a supportive work space that promotes equal opportunities and encourages women to be empowered. Each company searched will have a profile that includes the most relevant/helpful reviews and any history of sexual harrasement.
